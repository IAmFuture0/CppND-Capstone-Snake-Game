# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) with snakebot controlled by the computer using the A* search algorithm. The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The idea of added features are from the previous project **Build An OpenStreetMap Route Planner** and **Concurrent Traffic Simulation**. The snakebot follow the gray route planned by A* algorithm, and will stop immediately upon detecting a red light at an the intersection. It will move again once the light turns green.

By the way, I kept the code for the player-controlled snake in the program, but I commented it out. If you want to compete with the snakebot, feel free to remove the comment.

Additionally, you can build your own C++ application or extend the Snake game. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

The following diagram is the schematic of my program. The colored blocks indicate the changes I made: light blue for small changes and dark blue for the main changes where I implemented the new features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
